# 🧮 Matrix Calculator (Python GUI)

A beginner-friendly **Matrix Calculator** built using **Python** and **Tkinter** that allows users to perform basic matrix operations through a clean and interactive graphical user interface (GUI). This project was developed as a **final requirement for CS-121 (Advanced Computer Programming)**.


## ✨ Project Overview

This application helps users understand and perform matrix operations **step by step**, without needing advanced math or programming knowledge. The GUI guides the user from selecting an operation, entering matrix sizes, inputting values, and finally displaying the computed result.

It is designed especially for:

* Students learning **Linear Algebra**
* Beginners in **Python GUI development**
* Anyone who wants a visual and interactive matrix calculator


## ⚙️ Features

The Matrix Calculator can perform the following operations:

* ➕ **Matrix Addition**
* ➖ **Matrix Subtraction**
* ✖️ **Matrix Multiplication**
* 🔢 **Determinant of a Square Matrix**

Additional features:

* Input validation with error messages
* Step-by-step navigation (Home → Size → Values → Result)
* User-friendly GUI with background and icons
* Supports matrices of different sizes (with proper rules)


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** – for the graphical user interface
* **Pillow (PIL)** – for handling images

Install it using:

```
pip install pillow
```

### 3️⃣ Clone or Download the Repository

* Click **Code → Download ZIP**, or
* Clone using Git:

```
git clone https://github.com/marieldsilva/Final-Project-CS-121.git
```

### 4️⃣ Open the Project Folder

Navigate to the folder:

```
Matrix Calculator/
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Program

Inside the folder, run:
